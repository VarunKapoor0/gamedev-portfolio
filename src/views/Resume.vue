    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Varun Kapoor</strong>, a passionate game developer and graphics programmer with a strong foundation in computer science and real-time rendering.
      <br />Currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, I specialize in game engine development, physics-based animation, and real-time rendering techniques.
      <br />My technical expertise spans C++, OpenGL, Vulkan, and various game engines like Unity and Unreal. I have worked on optimizing game engine performance, developing custom shaders, and implementing physics-based animation systems.
      <br />My research interests lie in multimedia systems and pipelines for mixed reality, augmented reality and real-time graphics rendering.
      <br />
      <br />Right now I'm trying to find a summer internship. So if you have any opportunity feel free to

      <br />
      <br />Besides game development, I'm passionate about long walks, hiking, open-world and indie games and space opera books.
